# Parallelization-of-K-means-and-C-means

## Overview

This project focuses on the parallelization of C-means and K-means clustering algorithms utilizing the `mpi4py` library. By implementing these algorithms in a parallel computing environment, we aim to enhance their performance, particularly for large datasets, improving speed and efficiency.

## Objectives

- To implement C-means and K-means clustering algorithms.
- To leverage the capabilities of the `mpi4py` library for parallel processing.
- To evaluate the performance improvements gained through parallelization on large datasets.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- `mpi4py` library
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib` (for visualization)
  
You can install the necessary libraries using pip
